# HobbyKit

**Printable bases, trays, holders, and paint racks for the tabletop hobby, sized exactly how you need them.**

HobbyKit makes support-free STL and 3MF files for tabletop miniature bases, matching flying stems, Gridfinity holders, movement trays, low-profile spray trays, stepped paint racks, and gaming tokens. Pick a standard footprint or enter an exact one, choose the magnets you have, and export a model ready for the slicer. A base's size is embossed inside, so a loose print still tells you what it is: a `28.5` base says `28.5`, not `29`. Type your own label instead, such as a unit name or squad number; text that cannot fit the base is reported rather than dropped, and the filename still names the size.

Everything runs in the browser. Models are built locally and nothing is uploaded.

## Who is it for? 👋

HobbyKit is for hobbyists who need replacement, conversion, display, or movement-tray bases without searching for the right STL or redrawing the same part in CAD.

Built-in presets cover common Games Workshop, The Old World, Kings of War, and historical sizes. Custom footprints from 15–180mm work too.

## How it works 🧲

1. **Choose the footprint** by picking its shape, then a standard size or exact dimensions.
2. **Match your magnets** by setting their diameter, thickness, fit and depth clearances, and count.
3. **Tune the print** with the edge profile, wall thickness, top thickness, and internal supports.
4. **Check both faces** in the live 3D view, where dimensions, the export name, and the part's weight as solid PLA stay visible. Holders and spray trays show the total for every part. A slicer's walls and infill will use less filament than that.
5. **Save an STL or 3MF** built at a 1µm chord tolerance for circular geometry.

The [bases guide](docs/generators/bases.md) covers footprints, labels, magnets, and batch export, and the [flying stems guide](docs/generators/stems.md) covers stems.

## Gridfinity holders 📦

Add miniature groups, choose the available rows and columns, and HobbyKit packs matching slots into printable Gridfinity modules. Read the [holders guide](docs/generators/holders.md).

## Movement trays 🛡️

Move a rank-and-file unit for The Old World, Kings of War, or historical games as one. Read the [movement trays guide](docs/generators/movement-trays.md).

## Spray trays 🎨

Build a low-profile magnetic platform for batch priming and spray painting. Read the [spray trays guide](docs/generators/spray-tray.md).

## Paint racks 🖌️

Stand your paints in stepped rows so every label shows. Read the [paint racks guide](docs/generators/paint-racks.md).

## Tokens 🪙

Make a round, square, or hex token for objectives, Oath of Moment, or anything else a game tracks. Read the [tokens guide](docs/generators/tokens.md).

## Designed for one job 🎯

- Round, oval, pill, rectangle, and regular polygon bases.
- Hollow undersides with automatic ribs and magnet layouts.
- Printable 15, 20, 30, and 35mm flying stems with adjustable peg or ball-joint connections.
- Round, square, and hex tokens with wrapped text and traced image silhouettes.
- Stepped honeycomb paint racks for dropper bottles and pots.
- Shared magnet dimensions across bases, holders, movement trays, and spray trays.
- Balanced or five-pocket cross magnet arrangements for bases and holders. Saved cross layouts keep one centre pocket and four outer pockets on both axes, including elongated footprints.
- Exact size labels, filenames, dimensions, and high-quality exports.
- Browser-saved settings with shared base and holder preferences, and a confirmed reset for each generator or for the shared settings.
- Copyable links that open the current generator with the same settings.

HobbyKit generates bases and the hobby accessories around them. It does not sculpt miniatures, add textures or heightmaps, slice models, or control a printer.

## Private by design 🔒

The generator, 3D preview, fonts, and exporters all run locally in your browser. HobbyKit has no backend, accounts, database, or file uploads.

**Copy link** packs the current generator's settings, plus the shared magnet and wall settings it uses, into the part of the address after `#`, which browsers never send to a server. Opening the link applies those settings over your saved ones for that generator, then tidies the address so a reload uses your saved settings again. A token image travels with the link only while the link stays under about 8KB; otherwise the link is copied without it and HobbyKit says so. A base link leaves the batch export list behind, so opening one keeps your own.

## Development 🛠️

Development requires Node 24.x and pnpm 12.13.0.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
